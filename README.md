# Brainsight
## Intro

This is a machine learning project to guess if a patient has a brain tumor.

For this:
* I used opencv to detect the shades of gray of my images in my dataset. 
* Then I printed put the values in a numpy array
* Then I used a linear regression model with the gradient descent algorithm to finally guess.

## Issues
YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE FILES CREATED IN THE DATASET (.npy) everytime you start it again

## Things to do
* Remove the features everytime, relocate them as well
